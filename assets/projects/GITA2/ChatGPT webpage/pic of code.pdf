        <p style="line-height: 3;">
            ChatGPT may write responses that sound like they are correct, but are incorrect. </br>
            It may answer some questions differently or not at all even if both questions logically are the same, just worded differently </br>
            Sometimes it will give wordy responses and overuse some phrases, like how it's a language model trained by OpenAI. </br>
            When reponding to ambiguous questions, the model tries to guess what the question is, instead of clarifying it. </br>
            The model responds to inappropriate requests and show bad behavior.

    <h2 style="color:red"> How ChatGPT's ability demonstrates AI's power </h2>

        <p> 
            ChatGPT's ability demonstrates AI's power by being able to mimic a human conversation. It is able to give detailed </br>
            reponses to very complex questions. It is able to respond incredibly quickly, faster than any human could respond </br>
            It is always running 24/7, except crashes though that doesn't count. It can talk to multiple users at once, giving </br>
            good responses regardless of the amount of people using it. This is something humans cannot do, one person cannot talk to </br>
            thousands of people at once and give good responses to all of them. ChatGPT knows a lot of topics and has a large knowledge base </br>
            so it can give a lot of information about a lot of different topics. I even wrote this paragraph using ChatGPT
        </p>

    <h2 style="color:red; padding-top:60px;"> What are common things it is used for</h2>

        <p>
            Some of the things that ChatGPT is used for include: doing homework, learning about different topics, </br>
            getting help with questions, learning different recipes, help coding, and many more! The things you can </br>
            do with ChatGPT is (to some extent) limitless! It's like having an infinetly knowledgeable person at your disposal! </br>
