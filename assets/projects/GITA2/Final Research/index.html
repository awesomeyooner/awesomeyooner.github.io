							<h1>How can computing resources be misused and how can it be protected?</h1>
							<p>
								Computing resources can be misused by doing things like stealing, cheating, and attacking people. 
								</br>
								</br>
								People can do things like steal personal information from people, committing identity theft. Other things can be using resources like ChatGPT to cheat on homework. Countless people use ChatGPT to get answers on a homework assignment, including myself sometimes. ChatGPT is very useful, though is easy to misuse it. Other resources such as PhotoMath can also be misused to do students’ homework for them, making it hard for them to learn. People can be attacked online, being threatened or harassed to the point of suicide. There are many cases of this happening through social media apps such as Instagram and Snapchat. 
								</br>
								</br>
								These things are difficult to protect, though it can be done. Many companies and businesses are already working very hard to make data security harder to breach, though there are still cases. It is difficult to stop cheating, though maybe by having a way of detecting if something was written by ChatGPT it would students paraphrase instead of blatantly copying, because paraphrasing will still make the student think about the subject because they have to reword it but keep the same meaning. Attacks are also hard to monitor, though companies that develop the aforementioned apps are working on preventing attacks.
								</br>
								</br>
Computing resources are very powerful and can be used to do lots of good, however it can also be used to do lots of bad. With every innovation, people always find a way to misuse it, though in the future this will hopefully be prevented.

							<h2>How unauthorized access to information is gained?</h2>
								<p>There are many ways of accessing information, like scam calls and virus links. There are many groups of people who target and call certain people pretending to be something they are not, such as an employee of a company reaching out to a customer about a “false transaction” and that they need to put in their personal information to fix it. These people take their information and use it to steal their money. 
								</br>
								</br>
									Another way is to advertise for an application but in reality is a virus that steals information. Many people fall to this and get their information stolen. It may appear as a big green button that says “DOWNLOAD” or “FREE DOWNLOAD, though once its clicked it will download a malicious program that has access to your personal information.
								</br>
								</br>
									There are many ways of accessing information without directly breaching into something. They may take the forms as seemingly harmless links that will download what you were looking for, though is a fake download that installs a virus onto your computer. Many people use this information to steal money and to pretend to be someone else.

							<h2>The risks to privacy from collecting and storing personal information</h2>
							<p>
								When collecting and storing personal information, there are always risks for people to steal and sell your information. Hackers can steal your information and pretend to be you. When storing your personal information on someone else’s computer, ie Google Drive, there is always a risk that someone will steal your information because you aren’t in control of their property. When collecting personal information online, there might be people who are on the WiFi and can see the data being sent. Businesses might get a data breach and have a lot of sensitive information shared. 
							</br>
							</br>
							Furthermore, companies might lie about what they use with that information. A company might say that they will not share the information or see it, though some might lie and sell it to other companies to give you advertisements.
							</br>
							</br>
								Although companies invest in defending their storage and try their best to ensure that none of the data gets breached, there is always a chance that it might happen.

							<h2>How can computing innovation be beneficial and harmful? Also how can computing innovation have impact beyond its intended purpose?</h2>
							<p>Computing Innovation can be beneficial by improving the lives of people through ease of use items. These innovations can do things automatically to spare some time off of users to do other things. However, these can also be harmful by making people too reliant on these innovations and forget how to do simple things without them. 
							</br>
							</br>
								Innovations that can benefit lives can include: self driving cars and robots to do tasks like sort boxes. Self driving cars can be beneficial through things like getting a ride from someone or delivering something. These things will take the ease off of drivers for companies and make them more efficient. Robots that do tasks also do this, it will make the lives of people like cargo workers easier because the robots will do the heavy lifting and keep the physical labor to the machines and not the people.
							</br>
							</br>
								Although these are good, it can be harmful by taking away jobs of people and making us too reliant on these technologies. In case these technologies fail or are unable to be maintained, it is important to still have people capable of doing these tasks.
